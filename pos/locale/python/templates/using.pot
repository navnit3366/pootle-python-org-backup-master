msgid "Command line and environment"
msgstr ""

msgid "The CPython interpreter scans the command line and the environment for various settings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Other implementations' command line schemes may differ.  See :ref:`implementations` for further resources."
msgstr ""

msgid "Command line"
msgstr ""

msgid "When invoking Python, you may specify any of these options::"
msgstr ""

msgid "python [-bBdEhiOsSuvVWx?] [-c command | -m module-name | script | - ] [args]"
msgstr ""

msgid "The most common use case is, of course, a simple invocation of a script::"
msgstr ""

msgid "python myscript.py"
msgstr ""

msgid "Interface options"
msgstr ""

msgid "The interpreter interface resembles that of the UNIX shell, but provides some additional methods of invocation:"
msgstr ""

msgid "When called with standard input connected to a tty device, it prompts for commands and executes them until an EOF (an end-of-file character, you can produce that with *Ctrl-D* on UNIX or *Ctrl-Z, Enter* on Windows) is read."
msgstr ""

msgid "When called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a script from that file."
msgstr ""

msgid "When called with a directory name argument, it reads and executes an appropriately named script from that directory."
msgstr ""

msgid "When called with ``-c command``, it executes the Python statement(s) given as *command*.  Here *command* may contain multiple statements separated by newlines. Leading whitespace is significant in Python statements!"
msgstr ""

msgid "When called with ``-m module-name``, the given module is located on the Python module path and executed as a script."
msgstr ""

msgid "In non-interactive mode, the entire input is parsed before it is executed."
msgstr ""

msgid "An interface option terminates the list of options consumed by the interpreter, all consecutive arguments will end up in :data:`sys.argv` -- note that the first element, subscript zero (``sys.argv[0]``), is a string reflecting the program's source."
msgstr ""

msgid "Execute the Python code in *command*.  *command* can be one ore more statements separated by newlines, with significant leading whitespace as in normal module code."
msgstr ""

msgid "If this option is given, the first element of :data:`sys.argv` will be ``\"-c\"`` and the current directory will be added to the start of :data:`sys.path` (allowing modules in that directory to be imported as top level modules)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Search :data:`sys.path` for the named module and execute its contents as the :mod:`__main__` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "Since the argument is a *module* name, you must not give a file extension (``.py``).  The ``module-name`` should be a valid Python module name, but the implementation may not always enforce this (e.g. it may allow you to use a name that includes a hyphen)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Package names are also permitted. When a package name is supplied instead of a normal module, the interpreter will execute ``<pkg>.__main__`` as the main module. This behaviour is deliberately similar to the handling of directories and zipfiles that are passed to the interpreter as the script argument."
msgstr ""

msgid "This option cannot be used with built-in modules and extension modules written in C, since they do not have Python module files. However, it can still be used for precompiled modules, even if the original source file is not available."
msgstr ""

msgid "If this option is given, the first element of :data:`sys.argv` will be the full path to the module file. As with the :option:`-c` option, the current directory will be added to the start of :data:`sys.path`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Many standard library modules contain code that is invoked on their execution as a script.  An example is the :mod:`timeit` module::"
msgstr ""

msgid "python -mtimeit -s 'setup here' 'benchmarked code here' python -mtimeit -h # for details"

msgstr ""

msgid "Read commands from standard input (:data:`sys.stdin`).  If standard input is a terminal, :option:`-i` is implied."
msgstr ""

msgid "If this option is given, the first element of :data:`sys.argv` will be ``\"-\"`` and the current directory will be added to the start of :data:`sys.path`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Execute the Python code contained in *script*, which must be a filesystem path (absolute or relative) referring to either a Python file, a directory containing a ``__main__.py`` file, or a zipfile containing a ``__main__.py`` file."
msgstr ""

msgid "If this option is given, the first element of :data:`sys.argv` will be the script name as given on the command line."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the script name refers directly to a Python file, the directory containing that file is added to the start of :data:`sys.path`, and the file is executed as the :mod:`__main__` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "If the script name refers to a directory or zipfile, the script name is added to the start of :data:`sys.path` and the ``__main__.py`` file in that location is executed as the :mod:`__main__` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "If no interface option is given, :option:`-i` is implied, ``sys.argv[0]`` is an empty string (``\"\"``) and the current directory will be added to the start of :data:`sys.path`."

msgid "Miscellaneous options"
msgstr ""

msgid "Issue a warning when comparing str and bytes. Issue an error when the option is given twice (:option:`-bb`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "If given, Python won't try to write ``.pyc`` or ``.pyo`` files on the import of source modules.  See also :envvar:`PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Turn on parser debugging output (for wizards only, depending on compilation options).  See also :envvar:`PYTHONDEBUG`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Ignore all :envvar:`PYTHON*` environment variables, e.g. :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` and :envvar:`PYTHONHOME`, that might be set."
msgstr ""

msgid "When a script is passed as first argument or the :option:`-c` option is used, enter interactive mode after executing the script or the command, even when :data:`sys.stdin` does not appear to be a terminal.  The :envvar:`PYTHONSTARTUP` file is not read."
msgstr ""

msgid "This can be useful to inspect global variables or a stack trace when a script raises an exception.  See also :envvar:`PYTHONINSPECT`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Turn on basic optimizations.  This changes the filename extension for compiled (:term:`bytecode`) files from ``.pyc`` to ``.pyo``.  See also :envvar:`PYTHONOPTIMIZE`."

msgstr ""

msgid "See also :envvar:`PYTHONUNBUFFERED`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Print a message each time a module is initialized, showing the place (filename or built-in module) from which it is loaded.  When given twice (:option:`-vv`), print a message for each file that is checked for when searching for a module.  Also provides information on module cleanup at exit. See also :envvar:`PYTHONVERBOSE`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Warning control.  Python's warning machinery by default prints warning messages to :data:`sys.stderr`.  A typical warning message has the following form::"
msgstr ""

msgid "file:line: category: message"
msgstr ""

msgid "By default, each warning is printed once for each source line where it occurs.  This option controls how often warnings are printed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Multiple :option:`-W` options may be given; when a warning matches more than one option, the action for the last matching option is performed.  Invalid :option:`-W` options are ignored (though, a warning message is printed about invalid options when the first warning is issued)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Warnings can also be controlled from within a Python program using the :mod:`warnings` module."
msgstr ""

msgid "The simplest form of argument is one of the following action strings (or a unique abbreviation):"
msgstr ""

msgid "Ignore all warnings."
msgstr ""

msgid "Explicitly request the default behavior (printing each warning once per source line)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Print a warning each time it occurs (this may generate many messages if a warning is triggered repeatedly for the same source line, such as inside a loop)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Print each warning only the first time it occurs in each module."
msgstr ""

msgid "Print each warning only the first time it occurs in the program."
msgstr ""

msgid "Raise an exception instead of printing a warning message."
msgstr ""

msgid "The full form of argument is::"
msgstr ""

msgid "action:message:category:module:line"
msgstr ""

msgid "Here, *action* is as explained above but only applies to messages that match the remaining fields.  Empty fields match all values; trailing empty fields may be omitted.  The *message* field matches the start of the warning message printed; this match is case-insensitive.  The *category* field matches the warning category.  This must be a class name; the match tests whether the actual warning category of the message is a subclass of the specified warning category.  The full class name must be given.  The *module* field matches the (fully-qualified) module name; this match is case-sensitive.  The *line* field matches the line number, where zero matches all line numbers and is thus equivalent to an omitted line number."
msgstr ""

msgid ":pep:`230` -- Warning framework"
msgstr ""

msgid ":envvar:`PYTHONWARNINGS`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Skip the first line of the source, allowing use of non-Unix forms of ``#!cmd``.  This is intended for a DOS specific hack only."

msgid "Environment variables"
msgstr ""

msgid "These environment variables influence Python's behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid "Change the location of the standard Python libraries.  By default, the libraries are searched in :file:`{prefix}/lib/python{version}` and :file:`{exec_prefix}/lib/python{version}`, where :file:`{prefix}` and :file:`{exec_prefix}` are installation-dependent directories, both defaulting to :file:`/usr/local`."
msgstr ""

msgid "When :envvar:`PYTHONHOME` is set to a single directory, its value replaces both :file:`{prefix}` and :file:`{exec_prefix}`.  To specify different values for these, set :envvar:`PYTHONHOME` to :file:`{prefix}:{exec_prefix}`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Augment the default search path for module files.  The format is the same as the shell's :envvar:`PATH`: one or more directory pathnames separated by :data:`os.pathsep` (e.g. colons on Unix or semicolons on Windows). Non-existent directories are silently ignored."
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition to normal directories, individual :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` entries may refer to zipfiles containing pure Python modules (in either source or compiled form). Extension modules cannot be imported from zipfiles."
msgstr ""

msgid "The default search path is installation dependent, but generally begins with :file:`{prefix}/lib/python{version}` (see :envvar:`PYTHONHOME` above).  It is *always* appended to :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`."
msgstr ""

msgid "An additional directory will be inserted in the search path in front of :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` as described above under :ref:`using-on-interface-options`. The search path can be manipulated from within a Python program as the variable :data:`sys.path`."
msgstr ""

msgid "If this is the name of a readable file, the Python commands in that file are executed before the first prompt is displayed in interactive mode.  The file is executed in the same namespace where interactive commands are executed so that objects defined or imported in it can be used without qualification in the interactive session.  You can also change the prompts :data:`sys.ps1` and :data:`sys.ps2` in this file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Set this to a non-empty string to cause the :mod:`time` module to require dates specified as strings to include 4-digit years, otherwise 2-digit years are converted based on rules described in the :mod:`time` module documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid "If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the :option:`-O` option.  If set to an integer, it is equivalent to specifying :option:`-O` multiple times."
msgstr ""

msgid "If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the :option:`-d` option.  If set to an integer, it is equivalent to specifying :option:`-d` multiple times."
msgstr ""

msgid "If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the :option:`-u` option."
msgstr ""

msgid "If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the :option:`-v` option.  If set to an integer, it is equivalent to specifying :option:`-v` multiple times."

msgstr ""

msgid "Overrides the encoding used for stdin/stdout/stderr, in the syntax ``encodingname:errorhandler``.  The ``:errorhandler`` part is optional and has the same meaning as in :func:`str.encode`."
msgstr ""

msgid "For stderr, the ``:errorhandler`` part is ignored; the handler will always be ``'backslashreplace'``."
msgstr ""

msgid "If this is set, Python won't add the user site directory to sys.path"
msgstr ""

msgid "Sets the base directory for the user site directory"
msgstr ""

msgid "If this environment variable is set, ``sys.argv[0]`` will be set to its value instead of the value got through the C runtime.  Only works on Mac OS X."

msgid "Bob Savage <bobsavage@mac.com>"
msgstr ""

msgid "Python on a Macintosh running Mac OS X is in principle very similar to Python on any other Unix platform, but there are a number of additional features such as the IDE and the Package Manager that are worth pointing out."
msgstr ""

msgid "Getting and Installing MacPython"
msgstr ""

msgid "Mac OS X 10.5 comes with Python 2.5.1 pre-installed by Apple.  If you wish, you are invited to install the most recent version of Python from the Python website (http://www.python.org).  A current \"universal binary\" build of Python, which runs natively on the Mac's new Intel and legacy PPC CPU's, is available there."
msgstr ""

msgid "What you get after installing is a number of things:"
msgstr ""

msgid "A :file:`MacPython 2.5` folder in your :file:`Applications` folder. In here you find IDLE, the development environment that is a standard part of official Python distributions; PythonLauncher, which handles double-clicking Python scripts from the Finder; and the \"Build Applet\" tool, which allows you to package Python scripts as standalone applications on your system."
msgstr ""

msgid "A framework :file:`/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework`, which includes the Python executable and libraries. The installer adds this location to your shell path. To uninstall MacPython, you can simply remove these three things. A symlink to the Python executable is placed in /usr/local/bin/."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Apple-provided build of Python is installed in :file:`/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework` and :file:`/usr/bin/python`, respectively. You should never modify or delete these, as they are Apple-controlled and are used by Apple- or third-party software.  Remember that if you choose to install a newer Python version from python.org, you will have two different but functional Python installations on your computer, so it will be important that your paths and usages are consistent with what you want to do."
msgstr ""

msgid "IDLE includes a help menu that allows you to access Python documentation. If you are completely new to Python you should start reading the tutorial introduction in that document."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you are familiar with Python on other Unix platforms you should read the section on running Python scripts from the Unix shell."
msgstr ""

msgid "How to run a Python script"
msgstr ""

msgid "Your best way to get started with Python on Mac OS X is through the IDLE integrated development environment, see section :ref:`ide` and use the Help menu when the IDE is running."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you want to run Python scripts from the Terminal window command line or from the Finder you first need an editor to create your script. Mac OS X comes with a number of standard Unix command line editors, :program:`vim` and :program:`emacs` among them. If you want a more Mac-like editor, :program:`BBEdit` or :program:`TextWrangler` from Bare Bones Software (see http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.shtml) are good choices, as is :program:`TextMate` (see http://macromates.com/). Other editors include :program:`Gvim` (http://macvim.org) and :program:`Aquamacs` (http://aquamacs.org/)."
msgstr ""

msgid "To run your script from the Terminal window you must make sure that :file:`/usr/local/bin` is in your shell search path."
msgstr ""

msgid "To run your script from the Finder you have two options:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Drag it to :program:`PythonLauncher`"
msgstr ""

msgid "Select :program:`PythonLauncher` as the default application to open your script (or any .py script) through the finder Info window and double-click it. :program:`PythonLauncher` has various preferences to control how your script is launched. Option-dragging allows you to change these for one invocation, or use its Preferences menu to change things globally."
msgstr ""

msgid "Running scripts with a GUI"
msgstr ""

msgid "With older versions of Python, there is one Mac OS X quirk that you need to be aware of: programs that talk to the Aqua window manager (in other words, anything that has a GUI) need to be run in a special way. Use :program:`pythonw` instead of :program:`python` to start such scripts."
msgstr ""

msgid "With Python 2.5, you can use either :program:`python` or :program:`pythonw`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Configuration"
msgstr ""

msgid "Python on OS X honors all standard Unix environment variables such as :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`, but setting these variables for programs started from the Finder is non-standard as the Finder does not read your :file:`.profile` or :file:`.cshrc` at startup. You need to create a file :file:`~ /.MacOSX/environment.plist`. See Apple's Technical Document QA1067 for details."

msgid "Distributing Python Applications on the Mac"
msgstr ""

msgid "The \"Build Applet\" tool that is placed in the MacPython 2.5 folder is fine for packaging small Python scripts on your own machine to run as a standard Mac application. This tool, however, is not robust enough to distribute Python applications to other users."

msgstr ""

msgid "Application Scripting"
msgstr ""

msgid "Python can also be used to script other Mac applications via Apple's Open Scripting Architecture (OSA); see http://appscript.sourceforge.net. Appscript is a high-level, user-friendly Apple event bridge that allows you to control scriptable Mac OS X applications using ordinary Python scripts. Appscript makes Python a serious alternative to Apple's own *AppleScript* language for automating your Mac. A related package, *PyOSA*, is an OSA language component for the Python scripting language, allowing Python code to be executed by any OSA-enabled application (Script Editor, Mail, iTunes, etc.). PyOSA makes Python a full peer to AppleScript."

msgid "Installing Python"
msgstr ""

msgid "Unlike most Unix systems and services, Windows does not require Python natively and thus does not pre-install a version of Python.  However, the CPython team has compiled Windows installers (MSI packages) with every `release <http://www.python.org/download/releases/>`_ for many years."
msgstr ""

msgid "With ongoing development of Python, some platforms that used to be supported earlier are no longer supported (due to the lack of users or developers). Check :pep:`11` for details on all unsupported platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid "Up to 2.5, Python was still compatible with Windows 95, 98 and ME (but already raised a deprecation warning on installation).  For Python 2.6 (and all following releases), this support was dropped and new releases are just expected to work on the Windows NT family."

msgstr ""

msgid "Excursus: Setting environment variables"
msgstr ""

msgid "Windows has a built-in dialog for changing environment variables (following guide applies to XP classical view): Right-click the icon for your machine (usually located on your Desktop and called \"My Computer\") and choose :menuselection:`Properties` there.  Then, open the :guilabel:`Advanced` tab and click the :guilabel:`Environment Variables` button."
msgstr ""

msgid "In short, your path is:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":menuselection:`My Computer --> Properties --> Advanced --> Environment Variables`"
msgstr ""

msgid "In this dialog, you can add or modify User and System variables. To change System variables, you need non-restricted access to your machine (i.e. Administrator rights)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Another way of adding variables to your environment is using the :command:`set` command::"
msgstr ""

msgid "set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;C:\\My_python_lib"
msgstr ""

msgid "To make this setting permanent, you could add the corresponding command line to your :file:`autoexec.bat`. :program:`msconfig` is a graphical interface to this file."
msgstr ""

msgid "Viewing environment variables can also be done more straight-forward: The command prompt will expand strings wrapped into percent signs automatically::"

msgid "Besides using the automatically created start menu entry for the Python interpreter, you might want to start Python in the DOS prompt.  To make this work, you need to set your :envvar:`%PATH%` environment variable to include the directory of your Python distribution, delimited by a semicolon from other entries.  An example variable could look like this (assuming the first two entries are Windows' default)::"
msgstr ""

msgid "C:\\WINDOWS\\system32;C:\\WINDOWS;C:\\Python25"
msgstr ""

msgid "Typing :command:`python` on your command prompt will now fire up the Python interpreter.  Thus, you can also execute your scripts with command line options, see :ref:`using-on-cmdline` documentation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Finding modules"
msgstr ""

msgid "Python usually stores its library (and thereby your site-packages folder) in the installation directory.  So, if you had installed Python to :file:`C:\\\\Python\\\\`, the default library would reside in :file:`C:\\\\Python\\\\Lib\\\\` and third-party modules should be stored in :file:`C:\\\\Python\\\\Lib\\\\site-packages\\\\`."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can add folders to your search path to make Python's import mechanism search in these directories as well.  Use :envvar:`PYTHONPATH`, as described in :ref:`using-on-envvars`, to modify :data:`sys.path`.  On Windows, paths are separated by semicolons, though, to distinguish them from drive identifiers (:file:`C:\\\\` etc.)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Modifying the module search path can also be done through the Windows registry under the key :file:`HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Python\\\\PythonCore\\\\{version}\\\\PythonPath`. Subkeys which have semicolon-delimited path strings as their default value will cause each path to be searched.  Multiple subkeys can be created and are appended to the path in alphabetical order.  A convenient registry editor is :program:`regedit` (start it by typing \"regedit\" into :menuselection:`Start --> Run`)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Executing scripts"
msgstr ""

msgid "Python scripts (files with the extension ``.py``) will be executed by :program:`python.exe` by default.  This executable opens a terminal, which stays open even if the program uses a GUI.  If you do not want this to happen, use the extension ``.pyw`` which will cause the script to be executed by :program:`pythonw.exe` by default (both executables are located in the top-level of your Python installation directory).  This suppresses the terminal window on startup."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can also make all ``.py`` scripts execute with :program:`pythonw.exe`, setting this through the usual facilities, for example (might require administrative rights):"
